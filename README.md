I've constructed the "Bikeable Kenya Data Initiative" as a complete, single-file web application. This prototype is not just a mockup; it's an interactive demonstration of the entire concept.

Key Features of the App:
Privacy-First Landing Page: The initial view clearly communicates the mission and provides a strong privacy guarantee, building trust from the very first interaction.

Simulated Strava Login: The "Connect with Strava" button simulates a login process, transitioning the user from the public landing page to their personalized dashboard.

Personalized Dashboard: Once "logged in," users see a dashboard that acknowledges their personal contribution and displays their earned reward points, creating a sense of ownership and value.

Live Analytics Dashboard: This is the core of the initiative. It features:

Interactive Heatmap: An aggregated and anonymized heatmap of Nairobi shows popular cycling corridors, powered by Leaflet.js. This is the key visualization for planners.

Dynamic Reports: Users can filter the data by Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Annual views. This dynamically updates the statistics and the chart, showing how data can be analyzed over time.

Clear Metrics & Charts: Key insights like "Total Distance Tracked" and "Busiest Time" are presented in easy-to-read cards, accompanied by a chart showing ride volume.

Gamification: The rewards system is simple and effective: 1 km of shared data equals 1 point, which can be redeemed. This provides a tangible incentive for cyclists to participate.

Professional & Responsive Design: The entire application is built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring it looks clean, modern, and works beautifully on any device, from a mobile phone to a desktop monitor.

How to Use and Next Steps
Preview the Application: Open the generated HTML file in your web browser to experience the full interactive prototype. Click the "Connect with Strava" button to see the main dashboard.

Test the Filters: Interact with the "Daily," "Weekly," etc., filters to see how the dashboard data responds.

Backend Development: The next crucial step is to build a secure backend and database. This would involve:

Implementing the actual Strava OAuth2 authentication flow.

Creating a database schema to store user profiles and anonymized GPS data points.

Building API endpoints to receive data from users and serve the aggregated data to the dashboard.

Partner Integration: Work with local businesses (like "Bikeable Kenya") to create a real-world redemption system for the reward points.

This prototype serves as a powerful tool to showcase the vision to stakeholders, attract funding, and recruit developers to build the full-scale platform. It demonstrates that you can achieve powerful data-driven urban planning while championing user privacy and community engagement.
