Interactive Map: The app is built around a beautiful, full-screen map centered on Nairobi, using Leaflet.js.

Strava Integration: A clear "Connect Strava" button is ready to be hooked up to the real Strava API. For now, it simulates a successful connection.

Dynamic Route Filtering: You can tap on filters like "Offroad," "Hill Repeats," or "Less Cars" to instantly see relevant routes on the map.

Detailed Route Panels: Clicking a route pin opens a sleek, slide-up panel with rich information:

Key stats (Distance, Elevation).

A detailed description of the route.

Training Recommendations tailored to different athlete levels (Beginner, Amateur, Pro), just as we discussed.

Visually Stunning: The design is clean, modern, and mobile-first, using Tailwind CSS for a professional look and feel.

Ready to Scale: The code is organized and uses mock data, making it easy to replace with a live database and API in the next phase.

Next Steps & How to Proceed
Explore the App: Open the generated HTML file in your browser to see the app in action. I recommend using the developer tools to simulate a mobile device view, as it's designed mobile-first.

API & Backend Development: The next logical step would be to build a backend service and database to store and serve the route data, replacing the mock data in the file.

Full Strava OAuth Integration: We would need to register an application with Strava to get API keys and implement the full OAuth 2.0 flow to securely connect users.

User-Generated Content: Once we have a backend, we can build features for users to upload and share their own favorite routes after connecting their Strava accounts.

This prototype is the foundation. We can now build upon it to create the ultimate cycling companion for Kenya. Let me know your thoughts and where you'd like to focus next!
